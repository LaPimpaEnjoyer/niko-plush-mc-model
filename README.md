Hi! I'm AXAN (@nseptimid on Twitter), and welcome to my 'BlockBench Niko plush' repository. Bit of a mouthful, but still.

<h2>What is this?</h2>
This is a model I made with BlockBench in about an hour which intentionally looks like the plush of Niko from OneShot.


<h2>How does this work?</h2>
There is a ZIP file in this repository containing the the textures for the model (which are labelled according to their role), and a JSON file, which contains the model itself.
To open the model, you just need to import the JSON file in BlockBench and voil√†! The model will appear and you can do with it what you want*.

<h4>NOTE:</h4> the textures might not load right away because the path specified in the JSON file is probably not the same as the one you have (which is to say, if BlockBench looks for the textures in the Desktop folder, but they're actually in the Downloads folder, it won't load them);
If this happens, it should look like a bunch of checkered blocks with the same default texture on them; 

<b>to fix that, simply:</b>
  
  1. Right-click on the textures which it says are missing (they should appear on the left side of your BlockBench environment, if you didn't change where the menu is),
  2. Click on the "Change Path" option,
  3. Select the texture (they're all in the folder you downloaded) which has the same name as the texture you're trying to fix.


<h2>Can I use this in...?</h2>
The short answer is <b>yes, if it's not a commercial project</b> (mostly because it's based on an existing intellectual property and this is just something I did for fun). So if you wanna modify it, fork it, put it in your mod, in your model, in your drawing, feel free! But please don't sell shirts with the model printed on them. Thanks!

<h2>I have a problem/question!</h2>

Got any questions, concerns, criticisms? Feel free to shoot me a DM on Twitter at <b>@nseptimid</b>, I'll be glad to answer or to simply listen as you utterly destroy every aspect of my creation over the course of several paragraphs.

Alternatively, you can open a New Issue in the Issues section of this page. I can't guarantee I'll view it quickly, but it's good for posterity, in case someone has the same issue and needs it resolved after I'm long gone.
